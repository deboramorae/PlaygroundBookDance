 Ready to learn a little about dancing?
 
 In dance when we want to cause a sensation we use some variables to help: facial expression, movement velocity and stage presence.

 Example:
 
 **😄Happy:** Usually uses faster and wider moves.
 
 **😡Angry:** Usually uses medium velocity and stronger moves.
 
 **☹️Sad:** Usually uses slower and contracted moves.

 **💡Tips:**
 1. Choose an emotion:
 
        emotion = .happy
 
 2. To start dance change to:
 
        toDance = true
 
 3. Click on Run My Code
 
 4. Don't forget to turn up the sound volume.
